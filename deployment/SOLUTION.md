Deployment Module Documentation Summary
Overview
This document provides a summary of the deployment process for my classification model to a cloud-based service. I have packaged the model along with the necessary artifacts and a simple API, located in a directory named deployment.

Deployment Process
Model Deployment: I have deployed the classification model and associated artifacts to an AWS EC2 instance within a VPC. I configured the security group to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic, ensuring access for model predictions.
API Service: I set up a RESTful API on the Amazon EC2 instance. It's accessible via a public endpoint and allows clients to make prediction requests and receive label predictions in response.
CI/CD Pipeline: I manage continuous integration and delivery through GitHub Workflows. Any push I make to the main branch automatically triggers testing and, if the tests pass, subsequent deployment.
Testing & Linting: Before each deployment, I test my Python code with pytest and lint it with black to maintain quality and consistency.
Architecture Components
AWS EC2: I use this to host the deployed model and the API service.
Security Group: This is configured by me to manage access to the EC2 instance effectively.
GitHub Workflows: I have set this up to automate the CI/CD pipeline, including testing, linting, and deployment procedures.
Python Environment: I have ensured it includes all dependencies required to run my model and the API smoothly.
Deployment Criteria
I use only cloud services within AWS's free tier to avoid any costs.
I have automated the deployment process so that it requires no manual intervention.
Testing
I have written automated tests that confirm the API's responsiveness and the model's predictive functionality.
I run these tests on every commit I make to the main branch.
Post-Deployment
I am not required to keep the system running after delivery, which helps in preventing unnecessary costs.
Good Practices
I organize and comment my code and ensure it adheres to industry standards.
The documentation I have prepared is detailed to provide clear understanding and ease future maintenance tasks.
